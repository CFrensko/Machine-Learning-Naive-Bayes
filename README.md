# Machine-Learning-Naive-Bayes
In the mini-project l learned the basics of text analysis using a subset of movie reviews from the rotten tomatoes database. 

Background:
In the mini-project, you'll learn the basics of text analysis using a subset of movie reviews from the rotten tomatoes database. You'll also use a fundamental technique in Bayesian inference, called Naive Bayes. This mini-project is based on Lab 10 of Harvard's CS109 class. Please free to go to the original lab for additional exercises and solutions.

Basic concepts learned include: text analysis using the sklearn CountVectorizer class, Naive Bayes background and use, sklearn.model_selection, train_test_split, cross validation, iterating over possibilities and selecting hyperparameters.
